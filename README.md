# Aus_Data_Breach_Statements

This repository contains the analysis of data breach communicative statements publised by Australian companies that suffered a data breach between 2018 and 2023.
Since the establishment of the Notifiable Data Breach Scheme in 2018, companies covered under the Privacy Act 1988 are required tp notify an eligible data breach to affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). However, they are not required to notify the public.
Thus, these findings intend to shed light on how Australian companies communicate the data breach incidents to the public and what communication strategies are being used.

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis to discover interesting trends in companies' data breach announcements

- Text analysis techniques and machine learning models are employed which offers an automatic approach to classify communicative statements to the corresponding response categories
